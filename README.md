# VIMRC
This is my VIM configuration, and this repository is mainly for me so that I can restore it if it is ever necessary. Feel free to use it or whatever, I don't care.

The ```various``` directory includes some Menlo powerline patched fonts that I found. I patched the regular one to include the indent guide dotted line character.

Vundle is added as a submodule. To install the plugins run the standard ```:PluginInstall``` command and restart VIM.
